# Hiss

A partial implementation of R7RS Scheme in Haskell.

## Goals

1. Learn to bootstrap hygienic macro expansion.
2. Do something nontrivial with Haskell.
    * Get to terms with the 'nastier' stuff like monad transformers and IORefs.
3. See how various unfriendly features like (byte)vectors can be implemented in
   Haskell.
4. Keep the code nice and simple.
    * See what kind of performance that leads to.
